        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The following steps are for the creation of cheese sticks.</p>
        <p><em>please note the ingredients and watch out for anything that may cause allergies</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>17.5 ounce package frozen puff pastry</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil (preferably drained from a tin of anchovies)</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of frozen puff pastry dough onto a floured work surface and allow dough to thaw just until it can be unfolded. Unfold dough into a flat sheet; brush top of puff pastry dough with olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.

            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle white Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese onto the dough, covering the surface. Top with a piece of plastic wrap; press cheese and seasonings firmly into the dough with your fingers or by laying a sheet pan onto the dough over the plastic and pressing it down.</li>
            <li>Remove plastic and use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough down the seam lines into thirds; cut each third lengthwise into thirds for a total of 9 breadsticks.</li>
            <li>Pick up a dough strip, place it seasoned side down on the work surface, and twist from both ends 8 or 9 times to make a rolled tube of dough with the seasoned side out. Place breadsticks onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over the sticks. Roll the sticks lightly to even up their shapes and pick up and press any dropped cheese onto the surfaces.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes; flip and continue baking until breadsticks are browned and crisp, 10 to 20 more minutes. If you pick up a stick by one end and it droops, bake for several more minutes. Cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
        </ol>
